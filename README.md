Q61. Which Linear Regression training algorithm can you use if you have a training
set with millions of features?

Q62. Suppose the features in your training set have very different scales. Which algorithms might suffer from this, and how? What can you do about it?

Q63. Can Gradient Descent get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic
Regression model?

Q64. Do all Gradient Descent algorithms lead to the same model, provided you let
them run long enough?

Q65. Suppose you use Batch Gradient Descent and you plot the validation error at
every epoch. If you notice that the validation error consistently goes up, what is
likely going on? How can you fix this?

Q66. Is it a good idea to stop Mini-batch Gradient Descent immediately when the validation error goes up?

Q67. Which Gradient Descent algorithm (among those we discussed) will reach the
vicinity of the optimal solution the fastest? Which will actually converge? How
can you make the others converge as well?

Q68. Suppose you are using Polynomial Regression. You plot the learning curves and
you notice that there is a large gap between the training error and the validation
error. What is happening? What are three ways to solve this?

Q69. Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error
and the validation error are almost equal and fairly high. Would you say that the
model suffers from high bias or high variance? Should you increase the regulari‐
zation hyperparameter α or reduce it?

(without using Scikit-Learn).
